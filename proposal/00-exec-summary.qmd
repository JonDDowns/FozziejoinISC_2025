This proposal requests support for the continued development and publication
of `fozziejoin`, a performant R package designed as an alternative to the 
widely used `fuzzyjoin` [@fuzzyjoin] for approximate string matching.

`fozziejoin` currently implements 9 of the 10 string distance algorithms
supported by `fuzzyjoin`, with consistent improvements in runtime and memory
usage across Windows and Linux. Benchmarks show speedups exceeding 100Ã— for
certain algorithms, such as Hamming distance.

These gains stem from a Rust-based backend that bypasses the `stringdist`
[@stringdist] package, enabling efficient computation tailored to fuzzy
dataframe joins.

This proposal aims to:

- Implement the `soundex` algorithm and a `semi` join type, completing core functionality
- Align function signatures and outputs with `fuzzyjoin` for easy migration
- Finalize documentation, including vignettes
- Submit the package to CRAN

If successful, `fozziejoin` will support scalable record linkage in large
administrative datasets, with applications in public health, social science,
and government analytics. The project embraces open development and welcomes
input from the R community.
