# Signatories
<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.

## Project team
The project is currently led by the proposer, who is responsible for all development, testing, documentation, and publication.
Work will be conducted through a personal LLC, which will serve as the fiscal entity for receiving and managing grant funds.
While this is the proposer’s first open-source R package, they bring extensive experience developing proprietary developer tools for public sector applications.

## Contributors
No formal contributors are listed at this stage.
However, the project is designed to be modular and well-documented to facilitate future collaboration and community contributions.
A Contributor Code of Conduct will be included as part of the finalized documentation to support an open and welcoming development environment.
The documentation will make clear that the proposer welcomes feedback, issue reports, and contributions via GitHub.

## Consulted
During the preparation of this proposal, the proposer reached out to Hadley Wickham, an R Consortium member, who responded that the proposed approach “sounds like a good plan.”
He also noted that `fozziejoin` and [@fuzzyjoin] should remain separate projects due to differing installation requirements.
The code repository has been shared with the extendR Discord community, where it received positive feedback and interest from other developers.
