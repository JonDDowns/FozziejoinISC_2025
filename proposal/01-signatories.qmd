# Signatories
<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.

### Project Team
<!--
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if
the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to
go? Briefly describe all participants and the skills they will bring
to the project.
-->

<!--
Who are the people who have actively helped with this proposal but
won't necessarily be on the core project team later?
-->

The project is led by Jon Downs. Jon brings extensive experience developing
proprietary tools for public sector data science teams. Work will be conducted
through a personal LLC. A Contributor Covenant–based Code of Conduct and other
improvements will be developed to facilitate future collaboration and community
contributions.

### Consulted

During proposal preparation, Jon consulted Hadley Wickham, who
responded that the approach “sounds like a good plan.” The proposal and code
repository have also been shared with the extendR Discord community, where it
received positive feedback and interest.
