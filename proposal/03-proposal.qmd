# The proposal
<!--
How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you
will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and
how will you recover from them?

This is where the proposal should be outlined.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address
the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that
follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling
section.

Include concrete actions you will take and estimated timeline.
-->
To address performance limitations in `fuzzyjoin`’s string distance joins, we
propose a new R package: `fozziejoin`. `fozziejoin` currently implements
**9 of 10 string distance algorithms** from `fuzzyjoin`, with select benchmarks
showing 100× speedups on Windows and Linux.

These improvements enable **scalable approximate joins in R**, with
applications in **public health**, **social science**, and **government
analytics**.

The codebase is designed for **CRAN compliance**. This grant will:

- Improve alignment with `fuzzyjoin`’s interface and functionality
- Develop documentation and supporting materials
- Submit to CRAN

**Timeline:** December 2025 to July 2026

### Minimum Viable Product

The minimum viable product is a **CRAN-published version of `fozziejoin`**, including:

- The `stringdist_join` family of functions
- Comprehensive documentation and usage vignette
- An example dataset
- A testing suite

Interface and output will broadly align with `fuzzyjoin`, though exact
replication is not a goal. Differences and planned adjustments are tracked in
the following GitHub issue, and will evolve based on community feedback and
practical use:

### Architecture

`fozziejoin` uses Rust via `rextendr` to accelerate string matching in R.

### Assumptions

<!--
What assumptions are you making that, if proven false, would invalidate the project?
-->
This project assumes:

- `fozziejoin`’s performance gains will justify its installation requirements
- Alternatives like `zoomerjoin` are not direct substitutes for `fuzzyjoin`’s
  flexibility

If either assumption proves false, adoption may be limited or redundant.

### External dependencies

<!--
What external dependencies does the project have (e.g. libraries, services, other projects, etc.)?
-->

Requires R 4.2+, the base `stats` package, and optionally `tibble` [@tibble].
Source installs require `cargo`, `rustc`, and the `xz` utility. Once distributed
via CRAN, precompiled CRAN binaries will simplify installation for Windows and
macOS users.
