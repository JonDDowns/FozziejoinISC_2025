# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done
<!--
What does success look like?
-->

Success is defined as the public release of the minimal viable product on CRAN with all milestones completed.

## Measuring success
<!--
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use
along the way
-->
Progress will be tracked through milestone completion and public deliverables.
Monthly updates and quarterly summaries will be shared with ISC reviewers.
Community feedback via GitHub Discussions and social media will serve as informal indicators of adoption and interest.

## Future work
<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself
and/or the community in general?
-->

`fozziejoin` could be extended in several directions:

- Additional join types from `fuzzyjoin`, such as numeric distance, regex, or geographic joins
- Supporting `arrow` and other output modalities
- Utilize `fuzzyjoin` to create a `RecordLinkage` alternative

The project is modular and extensible, enabling future community-centered development.
