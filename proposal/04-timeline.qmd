# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively
detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is
important because projects need to get up and running quickly.

 - [X] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [X] Licence decisions
 - [X] Reporting framework
-->
The project uses the MIT license and is hosted on GitHub.
The Contributor Covenant will be adopted and GitHub Discussions will support
collaboration and feedback. Monthly updates and quarterly summaries will be
provided for ISC reviewers.

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should
provide at least a high-level description of the implementation.

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed
and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->
Development will span 8–9 months beginning Nov/Dec 2025, organized into four
milestones:

- By February 15, 2026: Add the `soundex` algorithm and `semi` join type.

- By April 15, 2026: Align function signatures and output structures with `fuzzyjoin`.

- By May 15, 2026: Complete documentation, vignettes, and source install guidance.

- By July 31, 2026: Submit the package to CRAN and respond to feedback as needed.

## Other aspects

<!--
How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number
of people? Please specify the open-source or creative commons license(s)
you will use, how you will host your code so that others can contribute,
and how you will publicize your work. We encourage you to plan content
to be shared quarterly on the R Consortium blog.

 - [X] Announcement post
 - [X] Delivery blog post
 - [X] Social media
 - [X] UseR!
 - [X] ISC meetings
-->
To publicize the work, the proposer will:

- Share announcements and delivery updates on the R Consortium blog at least quarterly

- Promote the project via LinkedIn and the extendR Discord community

- Submit a talk proposal to the next UseR! conference

- Attend ISC meetings as requested to provide updates and receive feedback

## Budget & funding plan

<!--
Outline the milestones for development and how much funding will be
required for each stage (as payments will be tied to project milestone
completion). Each milestone should specify the work to be done and the
expected outcomes, providing enough detail for the ISC to understand
the scope of the project work and assess the likelihood of success.

We expect that most of the budget will be allocated
for labor costs. We do not cover indirect costs. The ISC grants cannot
cover such things as travel, lodging, food, journal publication fees,
or personal hardware. Cloud services may be covered if they are specific
to the project and the project period. The ISC reserves the right to vet
how funds are used for each project separately. If in doubt, please reach
out to us.
-->

The budget covers labor costs for development, documentation, and CRAN prep
at \$100/hour — a standard rate for specialized R/Rust work.
The scope is defined for high-impact delivery.
