# The Problem

```{=html}
<!--
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this
proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up
for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [X] What the problem is
 - [X] Who it affects
 - [X] Why is it a problem
 - [X] What will solving the problem enable (why should it be solved)
 - [X] Brief summary of existing work and previous attempts (e.g., relevant R packages)

**Approximate string matching** is essential for data integration and entity
resolution in administrative datasets. In R, the **`fuzzyjoin`** package
[@fuzzyjoin] is widely used for this purpose, with 
**9,103 CRAN downloads in August 2025** [@cranlogs].

However, `fuzzyjoin` relies on the **`stringdist`** [@stringdist] package, which
is not optimized for this use case. It returns **all pairwise string distances**
as an intermediate resultâ€”most of which are discarded by a user-defined
threshold. This creates substantial and avoidable memory allocation.

Other packages, such as **`zoomerjoin`** [@zoomerjoin], offer performant
probabilistic methods via **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**. But LSH limits
algorithm choice and result accuracy, so `zoomerjoin` does 
**not fully replace** `fuzzyjoin`.
