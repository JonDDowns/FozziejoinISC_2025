# The Problem

```{=html}
<!--
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this
proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up
for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [X] What the problem is
 - [X] Who it affects
 - [X] Why is it a problem
 - [X] What will solving the problem enable (why should it be solved)
 - [X] Brief summary of existing work and previous attempts (e.g., relevant R packages)

Approximate string matching is essential for data integration and entity
resolution in administrative datasets. In R, the `fuzzyjoin` package is widely
used for this purpose. Download metrics for `fuzzyjoin` show
9,103 CRAN downloads in August 2025 [@cranlogs].

Approximate string matching is facilitated in `fuzzyjoin` via the `stringdist`
package. This approach is not tailored to the approximate string matching use
case, causing substantial and avoidable memory allocation. Namely, all pairwise
string distances are returned as an intermediate result. Most of these will be
discarded by a user-defined threshold.

Other packages, such as `zoomerjoin` [@zoomerjoin], offer performant 
probabilistic methods via Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). However, LSH limits
algorithm choice and result accuracy, so `zoomerjoin` does not fully replace
`fuzzyjoin`.
